## Features
- **Ultra-Low Resource Footprint**: True **0.0% idle CPU** and **~26 MB RAM** via Vulkan rendering (`QSG_RHI_BACKEND=vulkan`) with static idle budget.
- **Smart Daily Habits Rollover**: Daily recurring tasks automatically reset and uncheck at midnight live without restarting the widget.
- **Hold & Slide to Delete**: Native swipe gestures with red reveal and spring snapback animations.
- **Keyboard Fast**: Press `Enter` to instantly add tasks and calendar events; `Ctrl+R` shortcut for daily habits.
- **Date & Time Picker**: Clickable trigger button opening an expandable inline drawer with upcoming date chips and time slots.
- **Dual Views & Icon Filters**:
  - **Tasks**: Filter by All, Active, Completed, or Daily recurring habits.
  - **Calendar**: Filter by Today, Upcoming, and All events with in-app Google Calendar sync.
- **Emerging Adaptive Card**: Smooth Caelestia-style spline transitions when resizing or expanding, paired with Wayland `Region` click-masking so clicks through unused areas pass directly to your desktop.
- **Wayland Native**: Runs on `WlrLayer.Bottom` directly on your desktop wallpaper behind active windows with zero-lag pointer handlers.
- **Catppuccin Styled**: Integrated Mocha tonal palette with Material Symbols Rounded icons.
